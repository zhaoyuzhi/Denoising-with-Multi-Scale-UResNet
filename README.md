# Denoising-with-Multi-Scale-UResNet

The PyTorch implementation of different types of UResNet accompanied with residual learning.

## 1 Experimental Results

Given a noisy image from COCO database, the DnCNN can enhance it, but the results are not good.

The most important part is the residual learning, while replacing last layer as a sigmoid activated one is also good.
